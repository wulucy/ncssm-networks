# The NCSSM Network

This project explores the social media connections among students at our alma
mater, NCSSM.

## Methodology

We use "likes" on Facebook profile pictures to represent social connection.
Why not simply Facebook Friends? Since most students are friends on Facebook
regardless of whether they are friends in real life,
we elected to use "likes" on profile pictures as a more stringent metric for
legitimate social connection. Using this "likes" data, we construct the NCSSM
social network and conduct analysis.

## Data Notes

Data was collected from Facebook manually and via the Facebook Graph API.
Data is anonymized to protect students' information.

This project started as a final project for a network theory class with [Adithya
Balaji](https://github.com/adithyabsk) and Lloyd Liu.
